# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found an issue or bug that potentially affects the overall security of the project then please privately report the issue as a vulnerability to one of the core contributors such as Austin Born at austin@shinzolabs.com.

Please do not open a public GitHub issue sharing the details of a security related bug, and do not publicize the vulnerability in any other manner until it can be thoroughly reviewed by a core contributor of the codebase.
